## Design

### Colours
<img src="static/images/colour.png">

The colour and Design of this website was heavily influenced by the controvertial UX/UI design of the Gumroad website, I personally think that this is a great Colour scheme to stand out. the UX is also good as the user scrolls through the alternating rows and coloums Informatioon is displayed clearly and effectively, In this day and age of shopify stores built on templates I belive the end user will welcome this Unique UI as it is fresh new and exciting.

### Fonts
The font used is 'Courier New', Courier, monospace, this font plays the same role as the color scheme as it will be the same for everyone and not suit one brand more than another, some fonts can be too heavy or too light for their intended purpose and give off the wrong tone of a Product or brand, I think the chosen font is a happy medium to suit all brands and products


### Structure
Ease of use was the main goal for this site. and a clear path for both Buyers and Sellers to achieve their goals. I achieved this buy adding large text and icons to describe the use cases for the site.

## Future features / improvements

The send vendor email feature, is something that I will add in future versions, this feature will send a confirmation email to the seller as well as the customer. I would do this by implementing a function like below.
```
    # def _send_vendor_email(self, order):
    #     """
    #     stripe confirmation email
    #     """
    #     # get this working see if email sends to me and recipient then chnage to brand.email?
    #     brand_email = order.lineitems.product.brand.brand_email
    #     subject = render_to_string(
    #         'checkout/confirmation_emails/vendor_emails_subject.txt',
    #         {'order': order}
    #     )

    #     body = render_to_string(
    #         'checkout/confirmation_emails/vendor_emails_body.txt',
    #         {'order': order,
    #          'contact_email': settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL}
    #     )

    #     send_mail(
    #         subject, body,
    #         settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
    #         [brand_email]

## Bugs

**Bug**

Any superuser had full CRUD functionality over users stores in the front end.

**Fix**

View:
``` def edit_product(request, product_id):
    """
    edit product view
    """
    if not request.user.is_staff:
        messages.error(request, 'Only Store owners can edit products')
        return redirect(reverse('home'))
```
Template:
```
   <!-- crud for brand owner only -->
                {% if request.user.email == brand.brand_email %}
                <small>
                    <a href="{% url 'edit_product' product.id %}">Edit Product</a>
                </small>
                <small>
                    <a class="text-danger" href="{% url 'delete_product' product.id %}">Delete Product</a>
                </small>
                {% endif %}
```
**Bug**

Integration Error: invalid value for stripe.confirmCardPayment intent Secret:

**Fix**

This bug was caused by a syntax error in my implementation of the stripe client secret key, and was resolved once the syntax error was corrected.

**Bug**

Unable to change quantity of products in cart.

**Fix**

This bug was caused by an error in my cart templates and my qty-input-script file.
as the JS for this feature was learnd from the Boutique ado project and usses VarclosestInput and my template for the cart was not laid out the same as boutique ado the function could not find my quantity selector box. To fix this the most time effeciant way I chose to change the template instead of the JS file as I am more familliar with HTML than JS. In hindsight I belive an easy solution would have been to give my quantity selectors IDs and getElementbyId instead of .closestInput, I belive this would have had the same outcome.

```
  // increment quantity
    $('.increment-qty').click(function(e) {
       e.preventDefault();
       var closestInput = $(this).closest('.input-group').find('.qty_input')[0];
       var currentValue = parseInt($(closestInput).val());
       $(closestInput).val(currentValue + 1);
       var itemId = $(this).data('item_id');
       handleEnableDisable(itemId);
    });

    // decrement quantity
    $('.decrement-qty').click(function(e) {
       e.preventDefault();
       var closestInput = $(this).closest('.input-group').find('.qty_input')[0];
       var currentValue = parseInt($(closestInput).val());
       $(closestInput).val(currentValue - 1);
       var itemId = $(this).data('item_id');
       handleEnableDisable(itemId);

```

## Deployment
### Heroku Deployment

This Django application has been deployed from GitHub to Heroku by following the steps:

Installing Django and deploying to heroku

- 1. In the Terminal: Install Django and gunicorn: pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn
- 2. In the Terminal: Install supporting libraries: pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
- 3. In the Terminal: Create requirements file pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- 4. In the Terminal: Create Project (H2R): django-admin startproject H2R.
- 5. In the Terminal: Create App (blog) python3 manage.py startapp Post
- 6. Settings.py: Add to installed appsINSTALLED_APPS = ['H2R',] *Save file*
- 7. In the Terminal: Migrate Changes: python3 manage.py migrate
- 8. In the Terminal: Run Server to Test python3 manage.py runserver

Step 2: Deploying an app to Heroku

- 2.1 Create the Heroku app In heroku.com: create account/ login
- 2.2 Create new Heroku App H2R-PP5, Location = Europe
- 2.3 Add Database to App Resources Located in the Resources Tab, Add-ons, search and add e.g. ‘Heroku Postgres’
- 2.4Copy DATABASE_URL value: Located in the Settings Tab, click reveal Config Vars, Copy Text
- 2.5 Attach the Database: In gitpod, Create new env.py file on top level directory
- 2.6 In env.py Import os library, import os
- 2.7 Set environment variables os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in Heroku DATABASE_URL Link"
- 2.8. Add in secret key os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"
- 2.9 In heroku.com: Add Secret Key to Config Vars SECRET_KEY, “randomSecretKey”

step 3: Prepare environment and settings.py file
- 3.1 In settings.py: Reference env.py from pathlib import Path, import os, import dj_database_url
```
if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
   import env
```
- 3.2 Remove the insecure secret key and replace - links to the SECRET_KEY variable on HerokuSECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
- 3.2 Comment out the old DataBases Section
- 3.3 Add new DATABASES Section
```
DATABASES = {
   'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```
3.4 In the Terminal: Save all files and Make Migrations
```
$python3 manage.py migrate
```

- python3 reel2reel.py
- In a different browser tab, go to your app in Heroku and select the Settings tab
- Click the “Reveal Config Vars” button
- Copy the value in the DATABASE_URL Config Var. It will start with postgres://
- Return to Gitpod and paste in the URL you just copied into the terminal where prompted to provide your DATABASE_URL and click enter
- In your original browser tab, get your ElephantSQL database URL. Again, it will start with postgres://
- Return to Gitpod and paste in the URL where prompted
- The data will now be downloaded from Heroku and uploaded to your ElephantSQL database
- To test that your database has been moved successfully, return to ElephantSQL and select BROWSER
- Go to the browser tab highlighted as the third menu item on the left in an elephantSQL database details page
- Click the “Table queries” button. If you see any options in the dropdown, your tables have been created

### Connecting the ElephantSQL database to Heroku
- In the Heroku Dashboard for your project, open the Resources tab
- In the Resources tab, remove the existing Postgres add-on:
- Open the dropdown with the up-down arrows and select Delete Add-on
- (warning)Removing this add-on will completely remove the old database, so make sure you only do this after your data has been migrated.
- Confirm by typing in the name of your H2R-PP5 when prompted.
- Navigate to the Settings tab
- Reveal your existing Config Vars. The original DATABASE_URL should have been deleted when the add-on was removed.
- Add a new config var called DATABASE_URL and paste in the value for your ElephantSQL database, and click Add to save it.
- Add your new DATABASE_URL
- Click the Open App button and test your project. It should still work the same as before and have all your data. You should thoroughly test to check that all the CRUD functionality is working as expected on the new database.
